# Attack & Move (Re:Legend Mod)
Fixes the problem that you can't move while attacking, which is kind of a stupid restriction given that this game features combat and your character doesn't have feet made out of glue.

## Dependencies Required
* [BepInEx](https://github.com/Xaymar/relegend-mods/wiki#installing-mods)

## Installation
1. Drop the `.dll` file into `<GameInstallDir>\BepInEx\plugins`.
2. Play the game without standing still while attacking.
